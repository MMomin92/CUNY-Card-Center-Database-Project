# CUNY-Card-Center-Database-Project

Project Overview
This project involved designing and developing a database application to support the CUNY Card Center. Our team followed a structured approach to identify entities and attributes, create an Entity-Relationship (ER) model, perform logical modeling and normalization, and implement the database schema using SQL. The project aimed to ensure the safe and effective distribution of ID cards to students, alumni, visitors, and employees.

Project Objectives
Design an ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) to model the database for the CUNY Card Center.
Normalize the database to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity.
Implement the database schema using SQL, including the creation of tables and relationships.
Ensure the database supports efficient ID card distribution through various locations and methods.
Methods and Tools
Methods
System Analysis: Identification of entities and attributes based on the business case.
ER Modeling: Design of the initial and final ER models to represent the data structure.
Logical Modeling and Normalization: Creation of logical models and normalization to third normal form (3NF).
SQL Implementation: Writing SQL scripts to create tables, primary keys, and foreign keys, and to establish relationships.
Tools
Microsoft Access: Used for designing the database and creating the ERD diagrams.
SQL: Used for creating tables, defining primary keys, and establishing foreign key relationships.
Project Documentation
The following sections provide a detailed description of the project:

Scenario
The CUNY Card Center needs to distribute ID cards safely and effectively. A person requesting an ID card must provide a government ID, a photo, and their designation. Distribution methods include mail and in-person pickup at various CUNY Card Center locations.

ER Model
The ER model includes entities such as CUNYCard Center, CUNY Card ID, Person, Address, Request, Designation, Government ID, System Role, and Photo. Attributes for each entity were identified and refined through iterations.

Logical Modeling and Normalization
The logical model was created, and tables were normalized to 3NF. Functional dependencies were identified, and the normalization process was documented.

Database Schema Implementation
SQL scripts were written to create tables, define primary keys, and establish foreign key relationships. The database schema was implemented in Microsoft Access, and relationship views were generated.

Results
The database schema successfully supports the operations of the CUNY Card Center, allowing for efficient ID card distribution. The ERD diagrams and SQL scripts ensure data integrity and support various business requirements.
